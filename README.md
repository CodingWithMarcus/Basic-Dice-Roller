# Basic-Dice-Roller


if the user chooses Yahtzee, your program must roll and print to the screen five 6 sided dice. (Vertically printing these is fine. To print them horizontally would be an exercise in tediousness that will not prove your proficiency with function use. However, I'm certainly not going to complain if you want to do the extra work.)

If your user chooses D and D, your program will roll and print to the screen one of each 20 sided, 12 sided, 8 sided, and 4 sided dice.
